Welcome to UForIA, the Universal Forensic Indexer and Analyzer!

==========================
INSTALLATION/CONFIGURATION
==========================

- Before running the Uforia program, you need to change a few settings:

1) Edit those settings for the main program (like multithreading, starting
   directory and database) in: ./Uforia/source/include/config.py
2) You MUST use the MySQL backend if you are planning on using Uforia's frontend
   interface, sorry! At this point we do not have support yet for other backends
   in the UI. Make sure you set up your MySQL database beforehand and have the
   username and password ready to put into the configuration file.

OPTIONAL: If you intend to develop for/on Uforia, please read the documents and
          tutorials in ./Uforia/docs/
        
=======
RUNNING
=======

After successful configuration, you may start uforia by going into the
directory: ./Uforia/source/ and running Uforia: ./uforia.py

Except for some minimal output, you should not see anything unless you've
enabled the DEBUG setting.

Explore the database contents for the desired information.

OPTIONAL: After Uforia has completed its run, go to the frontend interface and
proceed to make your first mappings, visualizations and commence the Elasticsearch
indexing.

=====
NOTES
=====

The master branch is always in flux, as we are continuously developing and pushing
updates. That said, we generally test everything in our live demo environment, so
you shouldn't encounter any critical failures. If you do, please contact us or
submit a bug report!
