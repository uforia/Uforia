.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBreadpst\fR
is a program that can read an Outlook PST (Personal Folders) file and convert it into an mbox file, a format suitable for KMail, a recursive mbox structure, or separate emails\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-C \fIdefault\-charset\fR
.RS 4
Set the character set to be used for items with an unspecified character set\&.
.RE
.PP
\-D
.RS 4
Include deleted items in the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-M
.RS 4
Output messages in MH (rfc822) format as separate files\&. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will put each email together with any attachments into its own file\&. These files will be numbered from 1 to n with no leading zeros\&. This format has no from quoting\&.
.RE
.PP
\-S
.RS 4
Output messages into separate files\&. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will put each email in its own file\&. These files will be numbered from 1 to n with no leading zeros\&. Attachments will also be saved in the same folder as the email message\&. The attachments for message $m are saved as $m\-$name where $name is (the original name of the attachment, or \'attach$n\' if the attachment had no name), where $n is another sequential index with no leading zeros\&. This format has no from quoting\&.
.RE
.PP
\-V
.RS 4
Show program version and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-a \fIattachment\-extension\-list\fR
.RS 4
Set the list of acceptable attachment extensions\&. Any attachment that does not have an extension on this list will be discarded\&. All attachments are acceptable if the list is empty, or this option is not specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b
.RS 4
Do not save the attachments for the RTF format of the email body\&.
.RE
.PP
\-c \fIformat\fR
.RS 4
Set the Contact output mode\&. Use \-cv for vcard format or \-cl for an email list\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d \fIdebug\-file\fR
.RS 4
Specify name of debug log file\&. The log file is now an ascii file, instead of the binary file used in previous versions\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e
.RS 4
Same as the M option, but each output file will include an extension from (\&.eml, \&.ics, \&.vcf)\&. This format has no from quoting\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h
.RS 4
Show summary of options and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-j \fIjobs\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the maximum number of parallel jobs\&. Specify 0 to suppress running parallel jobs\&. Folders may be processed in parallel\&. Output formats that place each mail message in a separate file (\-M, \-S, \-e) may process the contents of individual folders in parallel\&.
.RE
.PP
\-k
.RS 4
Changes the output format to KMail\&. This format uses mboxrd from quoting\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m
.RS 4
Same as the e option, but write \&.msg files also
.RE
.PP
\-o \fIoutput\-directory\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the output directory\&. The directory must already exist, and is entered after the PST file is opened, but before any processing of files commences\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q
.RS 4
Changes to silent mode\&. No feedback is printed to the screen, except for error messages\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
Changes the output format to Recursive\&. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will put all emails in a file called "mbox" inside each folder\&. These files are then compatible with all mbox\-compatible email clients\&. This format uses mboxrd from quoting\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t \fIoutput\-type\-codes\fR
.RS 4
Specifies the item types that are processed\&. The argument is a sequence of single letters from (e,a,j,c) for (email, appointment, journal, contact) types\&. The default is to process all item types\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u
.RS 4
Sets Thunderbird mode, a submode of recursive mode\&. This causes two extra \&.type and \&.size meta files to be created\&. This format uses mboxrd from quoting\&.
.RE
.PP
\-w
.RS 4
Overwrite any previous output files\&. Beware: When used with the \-S switch, this will remove all files from the target folder before writing\&. This is to keep the count of emails and attachments correct\&.
.RE
.SH "FROM QUOTING"
.PP
Output formats that place each mail message in a separate file (\-M, \-S, \-e, \-m) don\'t do any from quoting\&. Output formats that place multiple email messages in a single file (\-k, \-r, \-u) now use mboxrd from quoting rules\&. If none of those switches are specified, the default output format uses mboxrd from quoting rules, since it produces multiple email messages in a single file\&. Earlier versions used mboxo from quoting rules for all output formats\&.
